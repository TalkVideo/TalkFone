/*
 * This API can be used with codecs that do not provide internal support for
 * splitting encoded frames in arbitrary-sized slices.  This is useful for
 * things like transmitting encoded frame over size constained packet 
 * protocols such as UDP. 
 *
 * The slicer adds 6 bytes at the beginning of each slice.  The 
 * format of this header is :
 *   - version: right now, first bit should be 0, the rest are undefined
 *
 *   - source id: 2 bytes random number used to identify stream changes in
 *     conference applications this number is transmitted in big endian
 *     format over the wire
 *
 *   - frame index number - used to detect a new frame when some of the
 *     slices of the current frame are missing (only the least significant
 *     4 bits are used)
 *
 *   - index of slice in the frame, starting at 0
 *
 *   - total number of slices in the frame
 *
