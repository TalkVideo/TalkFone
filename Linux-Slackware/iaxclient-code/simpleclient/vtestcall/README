Use the following command line:

vtestcall -F <codec> <framerate> <bps> <width> <height> <fragment size>
[destination]

See iaxclient/lib/iaxclient.h for codec types.
Theora is 24
H.264 is 21

Example:

Theora stream, 15 fps, 200kbps, 320x240
vtestcall -F 24 15 200000 320 240 1400

If destination is missing, vtestcall will wait for incoming calls.

The fragment size parameter is now working.  However, Asterisk seems to have 
problems with frames bigger than 4K so don't go over that.  

Right now, you need all parameters, mainly because command line parsing in 
vtestcall sucks and I am too lazy to fix it. If it bothers you, fix it
yourself and post a patch.
